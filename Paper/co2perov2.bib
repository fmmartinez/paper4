	abstract = {Rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves raise serious concerns about the ensuing effects on the global climate and future energy supply. Utilizing the abundant solar energy to convert CO2 into fuels such as methane or methanol could address both problems simultaneously as well as provide a convenient means of energy storage. In this Review, current approaches for the heterogeneous photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on TiO2 and other metal oxide, oxynitride, sulfide, and phosphide semiconductors are presented. Research in this field is focused primarily on the development of novel nanostructured photocatalytic materials and on the investigation of the mechanism of the process, from light absorption through charge separation and transport to CO2 reduction pathways. The measures used to quantify the efficiency of the process are also discussed in detail.},

Identifying the mechanism and the active sites involved in the formation of negatively charged CO2 species on TiO2 surfaces represents a significant advance in our understanding of CO2 photoreduction. To understand the role of the TiO2 surface acting as a photocatalyst mediating CO2 photocatalytic reduction, excited-state ab initio calculations of CO2 adsorbed on clusters from the (010), (101), and (001) anatase surface planes were performed. Both post-Hartree-Fock calculations on small model surface clusters as well as density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on larger clusters indicate that conduction band electrons in irradiated, stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces may not be transferred to CO2. On the other hand, oxygen vacancies may act as the active sites for CO2 photoreduction.},

A wide variety of stoichiometric perovskite oxides ABO3 (A = Ca, Sr, Y, La; B = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were examined as OER catalysts. The simplest descriptor, eg, electron number of transition-metal ions at the B-site, was not applicable for OER overpotentials ($\eta$) of the compounds tested in this study. Another descriptor, oxygen 2p band center relative to Fermi energy ($\varepsilon$2p), was not necessarily adequate for the most part of perovskite oxides. Eventually, a recently proposed descriptor, charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$), displayed a linear relationship with $\eta$ most reasonably. Because $\Delta$ values were obtained from theoretical calculations, not only by spectroscopic experiments, systematic exploration for a wide range of compounds including hypothetical ones could be allowed. This finding proposes the charge-transfer energy as the most helpful descriptor for the design of perovskite oxide catalysts for the OER.},

The highly relevant photocatalytic substrate for CO2 conversion could be the popular TiO2 surfaces. However, the lack of accurate measurements for the energy level alignment that determines the CO2 reduction on TiO2 has limited our ability to control these complicated photocatalysis processes. We report here a systematic study on the reduction of CO2 at specific sites of the rutile TiO2(110)-1{\texttimes}1 surface using scanning tunneling microscopy at 80 K. The dissociation of CO2 molecules is found to be activated by one electron attachment process with an energy threshold of 1.8 eV above the Fermi level (or 1.4 eV above the TiO2 conduction band onset), while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the adsorbed CO2 is located at 2.3 eV with respect to the Fermi level. The observed dependence of the dissociation rate on the tunneling current suggests that the reduction of CO2 induced by the electron attachment is a single electron process. These practical information can be used to guide the design of effective catalysts for CO2 photoreduction.},

However, traditional surface energy calculation method does not work for the asymmetric termination of MoP. In this work, we reported a useful DFT based method to get the surface energies of asymmetric MoP facets. Under ideal condition, the (101) surface with mixed Mo/P termination is most stable, followed by the (100) surface, while the (001) surface is least stable. Wulff construction reveals the exposure of six surfaces on the MoP nanoparticle, where the (101) has the largest contribution. Atomistic thermodynamics results reveal the changes in surface stability orders with experimental conditions, and the (001)-P termination becomes more and more stable with increasing P chemical potential, which indicates its exposure is possible at defined conditions. Our results agree well with the previous experimental XRD and TEM data. We believe the reported method for surface energy calculation could be extended to other similar systems with asymmetric surface terminations.},

	abstract = {Oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important quantity for enabling fast oxygen diffusion and oxygen catalysis in technologies like solid oxide fuel cells. Both previous literature in various systems and our calculations in LaMnO3, La0.75Sr0.25MnO3, LaFeO3, and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3, show mixed results for the direction and magnitude of the change in vacancy formation energy with strain. This paper develops a model to make sense of the different trend shapes in vacancy formation energy versus strain. We model strain effects using a set of consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated results may be simply explained in terms of vacancy formation volume and changes in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive vacancy formation volume contributes to decreased vacancy formation energy under tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to increases in vacancy formation energy with compressive and tensile strains, and vice versa. The vacancy formation volume dominates the linear portion of the vacancy formation energy strain response, while its curvature is governed by the vacancy-induced change in elastic constants. We show results sensitive to B-site cation, A-site doping, tilt system, and vacancy placement, which contributions may be averaged under thermally averaged conditions. In general, vacancy formation energies for most systems calculated here decreased with tensile strain, with about a 30{\textendash}100meV/\% strain decrease with biaxial strain for those systems which showed a decrease in vacancy formation energy. Experimental verification is necessary to confirm the model outside of calculation.},

On defect free surfaces and at lower coverages ($\Theta${\textless}0.2), CO2 is predicted to strongly bond (Eads\~{}-1 eV) to both SrO and TiO2 terminated surfaces in a monodentate structure with the C atom above a lattice oxygen. Adsorption energies, electron transfer to adsorbate, and bonding geometry are found to be strongly coverage dependent with smaller adsorption energies on TiO2 terminated surfaces at higher coverages.

Two substantial contributions to the error in GGA oxidation energies are identified. The first contribution originates from the overbinding of GGA in the O2 molecule and only occurs when the oxidant is O2. The second error occurs in all oxidation reactions and is related to the correlation error in 3d orbitals in GGA. Strong self-interaction in GGA systematically penalizes a reduced state (with more d electrons) over an oxidized state, resulting in an overestimation of oxidation energies. The constant error in the oxidation energy from the O2 binding error can be corrected by fitting the formation enthalpy of simple nontransition metal oxides. Removal of the O2 binding error makes it possible to address the correlation effects in 3d transition metal oxides with the GGA+U method. Calculated oxidation energies agree well with experimental data for reasonable and consistent values of U.},

	abstract = {We developed a ReaxFF force field for Fe/Cr/O/S, which is parametrized against data from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. Using this force field, we studied the Cr-oxide catalyzed oxidation reaction of butane at 1600 K. Our simulation results demonstrate that the active oxygen species on the oxide surface play an important role in the conversion of butane. Dehydrogenation of butane, which is found to be catalyzed by oxygen species on the oxide surface, initiates the reaction and generates butane radicals and surface OH groups. The radical intermediates are associated with the oxygen atoms to form C{\textendash}O bonds or make double bonds when neighboring carbon atoms are dehydrogenated, forming light alkenes. On the clean Cr-oxide, the major oxidation product is CH2O. The presence of iron pyrite (FeS2), a common inorganic component in coal-derived fuels and a major slagging component, on Cr-oxide accelerates the complete oxidation of butane forming CO2 and CO. Surface reconstruction by iron pyrite is probably responsible for the change of the catalytic behavior. Reoxidation of the reduced oxide surface can occur through removal of surface H2O and adsorption of gaseous molecular oxygen at the vacancy sites on the clean Cr-oxide. On the other hand, on the modified Cr-oxide, it is found that a considerable amount of SOH molecules are released from the surface. These results can provide the detailed mechanisms for the catalytic oxidation of alkane and product distributions in Cr-oxide catalyst and give, for the first time, atomistic-scale insight in the complex surface chemistry of these catalysts under realistic operating conditions.},

In the case of the PTO (001) surfaces, the adsorbate oxygen atom was found to form a peroxide-type molecular species along with a surface lattice oxygen atom on both PbO- and TiO2-terminated surface facets. On the other hand, the most stable oxygen adsorption site for the LMO (001) surfaces corresponds to the one expected from a natural continuation of the perovskite lattice. Moreover, the dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen varies from being only slightly exothermic on the PTO (001) facets to being highly exothermic on the LMO (001) facets.

In addition, electrochemical reactions as well as heat transfer process in porous anode are strongly affected by complex porous structures. It is believed that study of anode thermal properties are critical for SOFC design and operation. In this work, an AA model is developed for nickel and YSZ components via ASE, and a CG technique is further applied to represent Ni and YSZ beads by VMD, which are then self-assembled to capture the anode nanostructure via GROMACS. LAMMPS is then employed to evaluate average thermal properties of the porous anode. It is found that, at low Ni content (<=30 vol\%), thermal conductivity increases with increasing temperature due to lattice vibrations. Instead, the anode exhibits metallic behavior due to rich nickel phase. Thermal expansion of the anode increases with increasing nickel content. Average thermal properties of the anode are validated by open literature data with good agreement. This approach is considered to be applied to analyze nanostructures, heat transfer and temperature distribution in the porous anode, and is also useful to capture thermal performance of SOFC and stack.},

We report the use of ReaxFF to study the activation and conversion of propene to acrolein by various metal oxide surfaces. Using high-remperature MD-simulations on metal oxides slabs exposed to a propene gas phase we find that (1) Propene is not activated by MoO3 but it is activated by amorphous Bi2O3 to form allyl which does not get oxidized by the surface; (2) Propene is activated by Bi2Mo3O12 to form an allyl-radical and the hydrogen gets abstracted by a Mo=O bond, which is bridged via an O to a Bi-site; (3) Propene is activated over V2O5 to form an allyl, which is then selectively oxidized on the surface to form acrolein. The propene reations on V2O5 occur at lower temperatures than on Bi2O3 or Bi2Mo3O12. The results are all consistent with experimental observations, encouraging us that such investigations will enhance our mechanistic understanding of catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation sufficiently to suggest modifications for improving efficiency and/or selectivity.},

Suitable methods are studied to model SOFCs covering various length scales. Coupling methods between different approaches and length scales by multiscale models are outlined. Multiscale modeling increases the understanding for detailed transport phenomena, and can be used to make a correct decision on the specific design and control of operating conditions. It is expected that the development and production costs will be decreased and the energy efficiency be increased (reducing running cost) as the understanding of complex physical phenomena increases.

Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations.

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O2 systems. From simulations on methane/O2, o-xylene/O2, propene/O2, and benzene/O2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene \{{\textbackslash}textgreater\} o-xylene \{{\textbackslash}textgreater\} methane \{{\textbackslash}textgreater\} benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.},

	abstract = {Proton-conducting perovskites such as Y-doped BaZrO 3 (BYZ) are promising candidates as electrolytes for a proton ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) that might permit much lower temperatures (from 400 to 600 degrees C). However, these materials lead to relatively poor total conductivity ( approximately 10 (-4) S/cm) because of extremely high grain boundary resistance. In order to provide the basis for improving these materials, we developed the ReaxFF reactive force field to enable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proton diffusion in the bulk phase and across grain boundaries of BYZ. This allows us to elucidate the atomistic structural details underlying the origin of this poor grain boundary conductivity and how it is related to the orientation of the grains. The parameters in ReaxFF were based entirely on the results of quantum mechanics (QM) calculations for systems related to BYZ. We apply here the ReaxFF to describe the proton diffusion in crystalline BYZ and across grain boundaries in BYZ. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, validating the use of ReaxFF for studying the transport properties of these membranes. Having atomistic structures for the grain boundaries from simulations that explain the overall effect of the grain boundaries on diffusion opens the door to in silico optimization of these materials. That is, we can now use theory and simulation to examine the effect of alloying on both the interfacial structures and on the overall diffusion. As an example, these calculations suggest that the reduced diffusion of protons across the grain boundary results from the increased average distances between oxygen atoms in the interface, which necessarily leads to larger barriers for proton hopping. Assuming that this is the critical issue in grain boundary diffusion, the performance of BYZ for multigranular systems might be improved using additives that would tend to precipitate to the grain boundary and which would tend to pull the oxygens atoms together. Possibilities might be to use a small amount of larger trivalent ions, such as La or Lu or of tetravalent ions such as Hf or Th. Since ReaxFF can also be used to describe the chemical processes on the anode and cathode and the migration of ions across the electrode-membrane interface, ReaxFF opens the door to the possibility of atomistic first principles predictions on models of a complete fuel cell.},

	abstract = {Experimental studies of compressed matter are now routinely conducted at pressures exceeding 1 mln atm (100 GPa) and occasionally at pressures greater than 10 mln atm (1 TPa). The structure and properties of solids that have been so significantly squeezed differ considerably from those of solids at ambient pressure (1 atm), often leading to new and unexpected physics. Chemical reactivity is also substantially altered in the extreme pressure regime. In this feature paper we describe how synergy between theory and experiment can pave the road towards new experimental discoveries. Because chemical rules-of-thumb established at 1 atm often fail to predict the structures of solids under high pressure, automated crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods are increasingly employed. After outlining the most important CSP techniques, we showcase a few examples from the recent literature that exemplify just how useful theory can be as an aid in the interpretation of experimental data, describe exciting theoretical predictions that are guiding experiment, and discuss when the computational methods that are currently routinely employed fail. Finally, we forecast important problems that will be targeted by theory as theoretical methods undergo rapid development, along with the simultaneous increase of computational power.},

	abstract = {The practical levels of density functional theory (DFT) for solids (LDA, PBE, PW91, B3LYP) are well-known not to account adequately for the London dispersion (van der Waals attraction) so important in molecular solids, leading to equilibrium volumes for molecular crystals \~{}10{\textendash}15\% too high. The ReaxFF reactive force field is based on fitting such DFT calculations and suffers from the same problem. In the paper we extend ReaxFF by adding a London dispersion term with a form such that it has low gradients (lg) at valence distances leaving the already optimized valence interactions intact but behaves as 1/R6 for large distances. We derive here these lg corrections to ReaxFF based on the experimental crystal structure data for graphite, polyethylene (PE), carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and for energetic materials: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-s-triazine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), and nitromethane (NM). After this dispersion correction the average error of predicted equilibrium volumes decreases from 18.5 to 4.2\% for the above systems. We find that the calculated crystal structures and equation of state with ReaxFF-lg are in good agreement with experimental results. In particular, we examined the phase transition between $\alpha$-RDX and $\gamma$-RDX, finding that ReaxFF-lg leads to excellent agreement for both the pressure and volume of this transition occurring at \~{}4.8 GPa and \~{}2.18 g/cm3 density from ReaxFF-lg vs 3.9 GPa and \~{}2.21 g/cm3 from experiment. We expect ReaxFF-lg to improve the descriptions of the phase diagrams for other energetic materials.},

	abstract = {Parameterization of a molecular dynamics force field is essential in realistically modeling the physicochemical processes involved in a molecular system. This step is often challenging when the equations involved in describing the force field are complicated as well as when the parameters are mostly empirical. ReaxFF is one such reactive force field which uses hundreds of parameters to describe the interactions between atoms. The optimization of the parameters in ReaxFF is done such that the properties predicted by ReaxFF matches with a set of quantum chemical or experimental data. Usually, the optimization of the parameters is done by an inefficient single-parameter parabolic-search algorithm. In this study, we use a robust metropolis Monte-Carlo algorithm with simulated annealing to search for the optimum parameters for the ReaxFF force field in a high-dimensional parameter space. The optimization is done against a set of quantum chemical data for MgSO4 hydrates. The optimized force field reproduced the chemical structures, the equations of state, and the water binding curves of MgSO4 hydrates. The transferability test of the ReaxFF force field shows the extend of transferability for a particular molecular system. This study points out that the ReaxFF force field is not indefinitely transferable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To further increase its performance, microwave methods were used to increase the surface area of LCFCr and to decrease the synthesis time. It was found that the material could be obtained in crystalline form in only 7h, with the synthesis temperature lowered by roughly 300{\textdegree}C as compared to conventional methods.},

The force field has been fitted using density functional theory calculations on gas phase calcium{\textendash}water clusters, calcium oxide bulk and surface properties, calcium hydroxide, bcc and fcc Ca, and proton transfer reactions in the presence of calcium. Then, the reactive force field has been used to study the hydration of the calcium oxide \{001\} surface with different water contents. Calcium oxide is used as a catalyzer in many applications such as CO2 sequestration and biodiesel production, and the degree of surface hydroxylation is a key factor in its catalytic performance. The results show that the water dissociates very fast on CaO \{001\} bare surfaces without any defect or vacancy. The surface structure is maintained up to a certain amount of water, after which the surface undergoes a structural rearrangement, becoming a disordered calcium hydroxyl layer. This transformation is the most probable reason for the CaO catalytic activity decrease.},
